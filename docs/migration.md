# Migration


## From 1.x to 2.0.0
From version 1.x to 2.0.0, some work has been done to take it out of private release to a public one. Therefore, it introduced some breaking changes: 
- the id of the plugin changed
- recipes have new names
- some datasets generated by the webapp also changed

Some manual work is necessary to migrate your project to the public version.

Steps:
1. install "Visual Edit" plugin.
2. for each existing webapp created with the old plugin, create a new "Visual Edit" webapp.
3. copy the settings from the old to the new webapp.
4. start the new "Visual Edit" webapp.
5. go to the flow and notice:
- that you have now one extra dataset with suffix `<original_dataset_name>_edits`.
- that the source dataset containing the edits `<original_datasetÂ°name>_editlog` is still there and data is still present.
If this is the case proceed with the next steps.
6. delete the dataset generated by the old webapp named `<original_dataset_name>_editlog_pivoted`.
7. build the dataset named `<original_dataset_name>_edited` and check that the job is a success.

And you are done!
