# How to use the data table

- At the top of the data table is a header with, for each column...
  - Its name. Right-clicking on a column name will show a menu with options to hide the column, and to group rows by value.
  - A sorting arrow next to the column's name.
  - Its type. This can be "Number", "Text", "Date", "Checkbox", or "Linked Record" (see explanations below).
  - Filtering widgets for each column.
- The above options can be reset by clicking on the "Reset View" button in the bottom-left corner of the table.
- Changes in the original dataset are automatically detected and signaled. The user needs to refresh the webpage in order to see them.

## About Linked Records

- Linked Records are used for categorical data, to avoid free-text input errors.
- They correspond to records found in another dataset, the "Linked Dataset".
- They are edited via dropdowns which present all valid options, found in the Linked Dataset.
- The dropdowns include the ability to search through all options: when there are many of them, only options that start with the search term are presented.
