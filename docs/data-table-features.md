* Right-clicking on the column name will show a menu with an option to hide the column, and an option to group rows by value.
* Sorting is done by clicking on the arrow next to column name.
* Filtering widgets are located below each column name.
* All of this can be reset by clicking on the "Reset View" button in the bottom-left corner.
