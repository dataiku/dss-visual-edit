# How to use the data table

- At the top of the data table is a header with, for each column...
  - Its name. Right-clicking on a column name will show a menu with **options to hide the column**, and to **group rows by value**.
  - A **sorting arrow** next to the column's name.
  - Its type. This can be "Number", "Text", "Date", "Checkbox", or "Linked Record" (see explanations below).
  - **Filtering widgets** for each column.
- The above options can be reset by clicking on the **Reset View** button in the bottom-left corner of the table.
- Changes in the original dataset are automatically detected and signaled. The user needs to refresh the webpage in order to see them.
- When editing **dropdowns**, a search bar is included. Start typing, and only options that start with the search term will be shown.

## Troubleshooting

If the webapp isn't functioning as expected, clear the browser's cached images and files.

If you get a "backend" error, get in touch with your admin.
